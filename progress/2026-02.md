### Done
- Agreed on a lightweight workflow: discuss topics in chat → save an “outline-ready idea card” into `content/ideas/`.
- Added the first idea card:
  - **Agent-powered knowledge management system** (flexible input → agent processing/expansion → multi-format output; human makes key decisions).

### Next
- Decide the next 3–5 topic candidates, still aligned with the project’s focus:
  - Coding Agent practice logs (复盘优先)
  - Skills / workflow iteration
- For the knowledge-management idea, refine with 1–2 concrete real examples:
  - One-line Flomo idea → outline-ready card
  - Paper/video → NotebookLM → mind map/audio → WeChat post

### Blockers / Questions
- None.

### Links
- Idea: `content/ideas/agent-powered-knowledge-management-system.md`
- Project principles: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Naming rules: `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`
