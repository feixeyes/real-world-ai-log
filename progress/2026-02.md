## 2026-02-05

### Done
- Ran an end-to-end sample workflow for a new post idea:
  - Idea → Outline → Draft (`five-questions-building-agents`)
  - Generated 1 cover + 2 illustrations via Gemini Web backend
  - Uploaded images to WeChat 素材库 via Playwright + cookie injection
  - Inserted illustrations into the draft and saved to WeChat 草稿箱
- Added a TODO to improve cover image filenames (avoid generic `cover.png`).

### Next
- Stabilize WeChat editor automation:
  - more robust selectors
  - prefer "最近使用" image picking instead of filename matching
  - (optional) automate cover selection
- Move Playwright scripts into repo and document usage (so we can repeat this often).

### Blockers / Questions
- None (flow works), but WeChat editor DOM is brittle and requires maintenance.

### Links
- Idea: `content/ideas/five-questions-building-agents.md`
- Outline: `content/outlines/five-questions-building-agents.md`
- Draft: `content/drafts/five-questions-building-agents.md`
- Workflow docs: `.docs/workflows/wechat-draftbox-playwright.md`

## 2026-02-01

### Done
- Agreed on a lightweight workflow: discuss topics in chat → save an “outline-ready idea card” into `content/ideas/`.
- Added the first idea card:
  - **Agent-powered knowledge management system** (flexible input → agent processing/expansion → multi-format output; human makes key decisions).

### Next
- Decide the next 3–5 topic candidates, still aligned with the project’s focus:
  - Coding Agent practice logs (复盘优先)
  - Skills / workflow iteration
- For the knowledge-management idea, refine with 1–2 concrete real examples:
  - One-line Flomo idea → outline-ready card
  - Paper/video → NotebookLM → mind map/audio → WeChat post

### Blockers / Questions
- None.

### Links
- Idea: `content/ideas/agent-powered-knowledge-management-system.md`
- Project principles: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`
- Naming rules: `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md`
