# PROJECT — AI 实践记录 (Real World AI Log)

> 用大模型，做真实的事。
>
> Treat writing as an engineering system: practice-first, process-visible, iterative.

## 0) What this project is
- This repo is the local workspace for the WeChat Official Account **「AI 实践记录」**.
- The goal is not “write faster”, but to:
  - Learn through output
  - Use agents to manage repeatable thinking workflows
  - Turn personal experience into reusable systems
  - Allow failure, but not vagueness

## 1) Core principles (non-negotiable)
- **Practice-first**: only write what was actually tried.
- **Process visible**: keep decisions, doubts, corrections.
- **Small iterations**: each post is an experiment.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: AI executes; the human makes key judgments.
- **No authority tone**: honest, restrained, non-hype.

## 2) Repository workflow
Pipeline:
- `content/ideas/` → `content/outlines/` → `content/drafts/` → `content/published/`

Supporting areas:
- `research/` references
- `data/` feedback & review notes
- `skills/` reusable workflows
- `templates/` writing/review templates

## 3) Current focus (from README)
- Coding Agent practice logs
- Skills / workflow iteration
- Boundaries of agents in real projects
- Evolution of the writing system itself

## 4) Current inventory (what already exists)
### Ideas
- `content/ideas/agent-powered-knowledge-management-system.md` (added 2026-02-01)

### Outlines
- `content/outlines/我为什么开始做ai实践记录.md`
- `content/outlines/ai-coding-agent-三个没用的小项目.md`
- `content/outlines/生产力大爆发-程序员的机会.md`
- `content/outlines/沉淀工作经验为skills.md`

### Drafts
- `content/drafts/我为什么开始做ai实践记录.md`
- `content/drafts/ai-coding-agent-三个没用的小项目.md`
- `content/drafts/productivity-explosion-programmer-opportunity.md`
- `content/drafts/沉淀工作经验为skills.md`
- `content/drafts/沉淀工作经验为skills-发布包.md`

## 5) Project management (how we’ll move daily)
We track progress in two layers:
1) **This file (`PROJECT.md`)** = the stable project board.
2) **`progress/YYYY-MM.md`** = daily/weekly log for “one step per day”.

Daily minimum bar:
- Add 1 idea, or
- Improve 1 outline, or
- Advance 1 draft by a meaningful chunk, or
- Do 1 workflow improvement (template/checklist/skill).

## 6) Now / Next
### Now
- Build a steady ideas pipeline for Coding Agent practice logs (复盘体裁优先).
- Keep ideas “outline-ready” (core question + real example + proposed structure + title candidates).

### Next (2–4 weeks)
- Pick 2–3 ideas and turn them into outlines.
- Publish at least 1 post, then add a small post-mortem in `data/` (what worked / what didn’t / what to systematize).

## 7) Risks & constraints
### Naming convention drift
- `NAMING_CONVENTIONS.md` requires English-only filenames.
- Some existing files use Chinese names (historical).
- Plan: keep historical files for now; migrate gradually when touching them (rename + git move), avoiding breaking external links.

### Automation overreach
- Avoid “full automation fantasy”. The system should protect human judgment, not replace it.
