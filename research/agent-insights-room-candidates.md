# Agent Insights Room — candidate list

## Scoring rubric (quick)
- Decomposability (0–2): can we break it into concrete modules/behaviors?
- Reproducibility (0–2): can we run it or observe it reliably?
- Transferability (0–2): can we reuse the lessons elsewhere?
- Timeliness (0–1): recent updates / community interest
- Reader ROI density (0–3): improves workflow quickly

Total: /10

## Candidates (initial)

### OpenClaw (this is our first post)
- Why: we already run it; rich surface area (channels/cron/sessions/memory/tools).
- Notes: best for architecture + automation patterns.

### Cursor
- Why: high adoption; clear interaction patterns; many “how to use it well” behaviors.

### Gemini CLI
- Why: CLI-first agentic workflow; interesting prompt/command interface design.

### OpenCode / other open-source coding agents
- Why: easy to inspect architecture; good for patterns and tradeoffs.

(We’ll add scores after we do the first post to calibrate.)
