Canvas requirements:
- Aspect ratio exactly 2.35:1
- Output size target: 1584×672
- No logos, no trademarks, no real product UI screenshots.
- Clean, modern, readable on mobile.

Theme:
- Series: "Agent 洞察室" (Insights Room)
- Episode 01: OpenClaw
- Key idea: "agent as a runtime" — channels, sessions, tools, cron, memory connected as a system.

Visual direction:
- Minimalist tech illustration, flat + slight depth, high contrast.
- Center: a simple node graph / block diagram that implies a runtime: incoming message channels on the left (chat bubbles/icons abstract), a central "runtime core" block, and output artifacts on the right (document, checklist, clock).
- Add subtle lobster silhouette motif (abstract, not a cartoon), as a nod to OpenClaw, but keep it tasteful.
- Background: dark navy to black gradient with subtle grid.

Typography (in-image text, Chinese):
- Main title: 洞察室
- Subtitle: OpenClaw：把个人助理做成“可编排系统”
- Small tag: 01

Composition:
- Keep text area clean with enough padding.
- Avoid tiny text. Use bold sans-serif Chinese font style.

Deliverable:
- One single image.
