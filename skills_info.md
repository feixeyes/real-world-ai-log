## Dependencies & Relationships

*   **Image Generation**: `baoyu-article-illustrator`, `baoyu-cover-image`, `baoyu-comic`, `baoyu-slide-deck`, and `baoyu-xhs-images` likely rely on `baoyu-danger-gemini-web` (or similar backends) to actually generate the images.
*   **Compression**: `baoyu-compress-image` is a standalone utility but likely useful for optimizing assets generated by other skills before publishing.
*   **Risks**: The "danger" skills (`gemini-web`, `x-to-markdown`) rely on reverse-engineered APIs and carry stability/tos risks, which is why they include explicit consent mechanisms.

## Recommendations

1.  **Consent First**: Before using any image generation or X-related features, ensure the consent flows for the "danger" skills are completed.
2.  **Workflow Integration**: The `write-article` skill seems to be the governing workflow for text content, which can then be fed into `baoyu-article-illustrator` or `baoyu-cover-image` for visual enrichment, and finally published via the publishing skills.
